## Projects

### Concert database and booking system (Databases, SQL)
- Designed and implemented an SQL database to store ticket information of customers that attend concerts
- Developed SQL queries that generated detailed reports on ticket sales, revenue, and attendance statistics.

### Identification of patterns of visually inseparable photos (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- Trained AlexNet, MobileNet, Xception models on the dataset of dogs of the same breed that were randomly put into 2 classes using TensorFlow. 
- Visualized layers and filters of these neural networks to identify features the classification was made on. 

### Clustering human movement activity (Machine Learning)
- Performed data processing of Kaggle dataset by using dimensionality reduction techniques PCA, UMAP, T-SNE.
- Applied clustering techniques DBSCAN and K-means on the processed dataset and found outliers, correlations with health outcomes.

### Exploring sales trends (Data Analysis, Time series Analysis) 
- Provided insights for better decision-making by identifying patterns and trends in monthly sales dataset from Kaggle using Statistical Analysis techniques (EDA, trend analysis, residual analysis) and R libraries (TTR, forecast, dplyr). 
- Suggested an improvement on strategic planning process by predicting future trends and seasonalities on same dataset using ARIMA, and Holt-Winters forecast.
