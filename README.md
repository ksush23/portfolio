## Projects

### Concert database and booking system (Databases, SQL) ["**link*"](https://github.com/ksush23/ConcertsDataBase)
- Designed and implemented an **SQL database** to store ticket information of customers that attend concerts
- Developed **SQL queries** that generated detailed reports on ticket sales, revenue, and attendance statistics.

### Identification of patterns of visually inseparable photos (Convolutional Neural Networks) ["**link*"](https://github.com/ksush23/Feature-Extraction)
- Trained **AlexNet, MobileNet, Xception** models on the dataset of dogs of the same breed that were randomly put into 2 classes using **TensorFlow**. 
- Visualized layers and filters of these neural networks to identify features the classification was made on.

### Clustering human movement activity (Machine Learning) ["**link*"](https://github.com/ksush23/Clustering-human-movement-activity)
- Performed data processing of **Kaggle** dataset by using dimensionality reduction techniques **PCA, UMAP, T-SNE**.
- Applied clustering techniques **DBSCAN** and **K-means** on the processed dataset and found outliers, correlations with health outcomes.

### Exploring sales trends (Data Analysis, Time series Analysis) ["**link*"](https://github.com/ksush23/Lab-time-series)
- Provided insights for better decision-making by identifying patterns and trends in monthly sales dataset from **Kaggle** using **Statistical Analysis** techniques (EDA, trend analysis, residual analysis) and **R** libraries (TTR, forecast, dplyr). 
- Suggested an improvement on strategic planning process by predicting future trends and seasonalities on same dataset using **ARIMA**, and **Holt-Winters** forecast.
